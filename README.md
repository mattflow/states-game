# States Game

[mattflow.github.io/states-game](https://mattflow.github.io/states-game)

A fun drinking game to play with a group of people.

## Rules

Take turns naming all 50 states without repeating one that has been previously said. If it has been said already, you drink!

## Motivation

My friends and I play this game all the time when we are out and we finally got tired of writing all 50 states on a napkin, so I made it into a webpage! Try it out, I promise you'll be surprised how hard it gets when you only have two or three states left!
