# States Game

[states.mattflow.dev](https://states.mattflow.dev)

A fun drinking game to play with a group of people.

This is a game me and my friends play at the bar. We got tired of writing all 50 states
on a napkin, so I put it on the web. You and your friends take turns naming states. If
you name a state that has already been said, you take a drink. Get all 50 to win.
